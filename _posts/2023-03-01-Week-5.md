In Go, structs are composite data types that allow you to group together zero or more values of different types under a single name. They are similar to classes in object-oriented programming languages but lack some of the features such as inheritance and methods.

Here is an example of a struct definition in Go:

```
type Person struct {
    Name    string
    Age     int
    Address Address
}

type Address struct {
    Street  string
    City    string
    Country string
}
```
In this example, we define two structs: Person and Address. The Person struct has three fields: Name, Age, and Address. The Address field is itself a struct with three fields: Street, City, and Country.

To create an instance of a struct, you can use the var keyword and assign values to its fields:

```
var john Person
john.Name = "John Doe"
john.Age = 30
john.Address = Address{"123 Main St", "Anytown", "USA"}
```
Alternatively, we can use a struct literal to create and initialize a struct in one line:

```
john := Person{Name: "John Doe", Age: 30, Address: Address{"123 Main St", "Anytown", "USA"}}
```
We can also define methods on a struct by defining a function with a receiver argument of the struct type:

```
func (p Person) SayHello() {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, my name is %s and I am %d years old.\n", p.Name, p.Age)
}

john.SayHello() // Output: Hello, my name is John Doe and I am 30 years old.

```


Overall, structs are a powerful and flexible feature of Go that allow you to define custom types that can be used to organize and manipulate data in your programs.

***THE CHALLENGE***
The major problem I faced during learning Structs was the syntax, for example

```
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
    Name    string
    Age     int
    Address Address
}

type Address struct {
    Street  string
    City    string
    Country string
}

func main() {
    // Define a new Person struct
    john := Person{
        Name: "John Doe",
        Age: 30,
        Address: Address{
            Street: "123 Main St",
            City: "Anytown",
            Country: "USA",
        },
    }

    // Print out the person's name and address
    fmt.Printf("%s lives at %s, %s, %s\n", john.Name, john.Address.Street, john.Address.City, john.Address.Country)
}
```

The structure for defining ***Address*** did take some time to understand but after consecutively writing the code in 2 files did improve how the implementation works 
I hope to implement ***Struct*** in more examples in the future
