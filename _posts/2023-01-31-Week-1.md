Week 1 Progress Report 

The start of this week was interesting in terms of learning the language as i started to keep this week light and learn more about the basics of the code than rather doing the actual code hence there are only 5 exercises that can be seen on github, these folders contain basic executions of how the code is actually run and how you can play with the code, this week was majorly learning about the variable usage and how do you display the values on the screen. Starting next week the exercises have an increased difficulty than this week making it more interesting and more intense to learn.
