Week 1 Progress Report 

The start of this week was interesting in terms of learning the language as Go has similar execution as python where we use the command

```
Go mod init 
Go run filename.go
```

The init mod functionality is used to create a modular file which keeps the data of the file

In this week I learnt more about how to actually execute the commands and how does loops, Storing values to functions work 
also create **Custom Variables** which was quite interesting to learn. This week was quite interesting to see how does the execution work and how can I more improve on this.


> FMT package

The basic of GO is through this FMT package 
this package enables the user to print the statements which are executed 

a basic example of this would be 

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Hello int

var x Hello

func main() {
	fmt.Println(x)
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", x)
	x = 42
	fmt.Println(x)
}

```

In the above example the value in x is displayed on the screen 

The next week may even bring more challenges and it will be much interesting to learn
