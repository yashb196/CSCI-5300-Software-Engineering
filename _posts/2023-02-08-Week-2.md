Week 2 Progress Report 

This week was all about Numbers where I played with a number of commands related to Calculations and constants

I Learnt more about constants and how to actually print these values.
Also how to use Operators in GO 

```
g. ==
h. <=
i. >=
j. !=
k. <
l. >

```

Surprisingly the Implementation for these operators is quite simple where you can directly implement these values

```
    a := (12 == 12)
	b := (12 <= 13)
	c := (12 >= 13)
	d := (12 != 13)
	e := (12 > 13)
	f := (12 < 13)
```


The answers are displayed accordingly 


Along with this I also did learn more about the use of Constants and how their values are called and implemented when writing a code base 

```
import (
	"fmt"
)

const (
	a     = 42
	b int = 46
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}


```

The progress is interesting and i am actually intruiged to learn more about **Golang** as it progresses
