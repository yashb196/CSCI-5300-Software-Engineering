Programming language Golang
1. Go or golang being one of the languages introduced by google makes it fascinating to learn and to know more about,
as this language is said to be used as a replacement for the current backend node js,

Why Learn Go
1. My goal from masters is to become a Website developer and learning this language should help me get closer to my dream to become a web developer
2. Golang was a language not known to me until recent times, 
But a few days back i received an opportunity to become a teaching assistant for Artificial Intelligence, 
With that opportunity the projects that were supposed to be done by the students should be in Go,
I took this as an opportunity and as I entered the Software Engineering class we were instructed that we need to learn a new language through this whole course so,
I thought to myself why not integrate both in one and learn the language and also work on the projects related to GO at the same time. 
This is my motivation to learn GO"
