This week was learning about Array and Slices in Go 
Arrays

An array is a fixed-length sequence of values of the same type. In Go, arrays are declared with a specific length and type:

```
var a [5]int // an array of five integers
In this example, we declare an array a of length 5 and type int. We can initialize the array when we declare it like this:


a := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // initialize the array with values
We can access the elements of an array using square brackets []:


fmt.Println(a[0]) // prints 1
fmt.Println(a[1]) // prints 2
```

We can also change the value of an element in the array:

```
a[0] = 10 // change the first element to 10
fmt.Println(a[0]) // prints 10
```

One important thing to note about arrays in Go is that they are passed by value. This means that when you pass an array to a function, a copy of the array is created:

```
func modifyArray(a [5]int) {
    a[0] = 10
    fmt.Println(a) // prints [10 2 3 4 5]
}

a := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
modifyArray(a)
fmt.Println(a) // prints [1 2 3 4 5]
```

As you can see, the modifyArray function modifies the array locally, but the changes are not reflected outside of the function.

Slices

A slice is a dynamic, resizable sequence of values of the same type. In Go, slices are declared without a length:

```
var s []int // a slice of integers
We can initialize a slice using a slice literal:


s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // initialize the slice with values
We can also create a slice from an array using the slicing syntax:


a := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
s := a[1:4] // create a slice from the second to fourth elements of a
fmt.Println(s) // prints [2 3 4]

```

In this example, s is a slice of a that includes elements 1, 2, and 3. The slicing syntax is a[start:end], where start is the index of the first element to include in the slice, and end is the index of the first element to exclude from the slice.

One important thing to note about slices is that they are passed by reference. This means that when you pass a slice to a function, a reference to the original slice is passed:

```
func modifySlice(s []int) {
    s[0] = 10
    fmt.Println(s) // prints [10 2 3 4 5]
}

s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
modifySlice(s)
fmt.Println(s) // prints [10 2 3 4 5]
```

*** THE CHALLENGE ***

Slicing requires a proper syntax and method for it to be executed for example in on of the programs there was a problem where I had to slice and display the values in between the array 
I did not know how to exactly print these statements 
It did take time to understand the situation but after knowing how it is done the program did seem easy and I could successfully use the  **Slice** 
function
