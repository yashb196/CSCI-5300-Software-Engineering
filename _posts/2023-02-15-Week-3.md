Week 3 was about Learning Loops where I did learn more about Loops such as If loop For loop how to structure them and how to create code around loops.

**THE CHALLENGES**

The challenges for learning each loop is how exactly the syntax work. for example in the example below

```

// print every year from your birthdate to current year
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	bd := 1996
	for bd <= 2022 {
		fmt.Println(bd)
		bd++
	}
}

```

to understand how actually the loop is actually different from oython where the loops are much easier to implement, here the values are direct but the syntax is different which was a small learning curve but being efficient in different languages i did learn and implemented it well.

By next week i may be able to understand how does functions and objects work in Golang Looking forward to it.
